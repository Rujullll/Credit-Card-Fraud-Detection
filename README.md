Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
        <h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h1>
<h2>Task Objectives</h2>
        <p>The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset of transaction details, the model predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. Key elements include handling class imbalance, data preprocessing, and the application of classification algorithms.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loaded the dataset.</li>
                    <li>Separated features and the target variable (<code>Class</code>).</li>
                    <li>Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).</li>
                    <li>Split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used a Random Forest Classifier to train the model.</li>
                    <li>Fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Evaluated the model's performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Class Imbalance:</strong> The dataset contained a significant imbalance between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Addressed using SMOTE to oversample the minority class.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Ensured irrelevant features were removed to optimize model performance.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confusion Matrix:</strong> Provided insights into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Classification Report:</strong> Achieved high precision and recall for fraudulent transaction detection.</li>
        </ul>


<h2>Results Achieved</h2>
        <p>The model successfully identified fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. Precision, Recall, and F1-score ensured a balance between false positives and negatives.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The project demonstrates a robust approach to detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. Handling class imbalance and tuning model parameters played a critical role in achieving high performance.</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment with other algorithms like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.</li>
            <li>Apply feature engineering to derive new insights.</li>
            <li>Use ensemble techniques to improve model robustness.</li>
        </ul>
